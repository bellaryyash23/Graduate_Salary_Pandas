# Data Exploration of Post-University Salaries of Graduates by Major using Pandas of Python 

🌟College degrees are very expensive. But, do they pay you back? Choosing Philosophy or International Relations as a major may have worried your parents, but does the data back up their fears? PayScale Inc. did a year-long survey of 1.2 million Americans with only a bachelor's degree. We have be digging into this data and used Pandas to answer these questions.

❓Which degrees have the highest starting salaries? 

❓Which majors have the lowest earnings after college?

❓Which degrees have the highest earning potential?

❓What are the lowest risk college majors from an earnings standpoint?

❓Do business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) or HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Science) degrees earn more on average?

🐼Used Pandas to answer all these questions🐼

✅The use of .head(), .tail(), .shape and .columns to explore your DataFrame and find out the number of rows and columns as well as the column names.

✅Look for NaN (not a number) values with .findna() and consider using .dropna() to clean up your DataFrame

✅Access entire columns of a DataFrame using the square bracket notation: df['column name'] or df[['column name 1', 'column name 2', 'column name 3']]

✅Access individual cells in a DataFrame by chaining square brackets df['column name'][index] or using df['column name'].loc[index]

✅The largest and smallest values, as well as their positions, can be found with methods like .max(), .min(), .idxmax() and .idxmin()

✅Sort the DataFrame with .sort_values() and add new columns with .insert()

✅Create an Excel Style Pivot Table by grouping entries that belong to a particular category use the .groupby() method
